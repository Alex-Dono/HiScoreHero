# HiScoreHero

HiScoreHero is a turn based game rpg adventure in which you will battle against monsters and try to beat as many as you can in order to set a high score.

When you won't find an enemy you will find a potion that will be added to your inventory for you to use it when you need to replenish your health.

If you have a java environment on your machine you can start the game by opening the terminal, getting to the directory the jar file is in and then run:
```
java -jar HiScoreHero.jar
```

This is a Java based project, the UI was made using the Swing framework.
